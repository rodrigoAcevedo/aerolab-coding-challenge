Coding challenge for aerolab

This is the 1.0 version for the Aerolab coding Challenge.

Some notes about it's development:

* It's mainly done on HTML, CSS and pure Javascript (with a little of jquery for some UI management.)
* It uses bootstrap for the layout.
* Use of the token is hardcoded on js/ajax.js inside a configParams object, as long with the URL's for the API.
* Makes use of javascript promises to work in an asynchronic way with the UI and allow the user to interact while processes run under the hood.
